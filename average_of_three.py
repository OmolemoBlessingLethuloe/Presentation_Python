# This method takes in three numbers and returns the average 
# of those three numbers



##### SOLUTION 1

# def average_of_three(num1, num2, num3):
#     return (num1 + num2 + num3) // 3

# print(average_of_three(2,4,6))




##### SOLUTION 2

# def average_of_three(num1, num2, num3):
#     # assigning the answer to a variable
#     average = (num1 + num2 + num3) // 3
#     return average

# print(average_of_three(2,4,6))
