# Presentation_Python

This is a set of problems solved using Python as an assignment at the GirlCode Software Development Learnership

* 1. Write a method is_palidrome(word), that takes in a string word and returns the true if the word is a palidrome, false otherwise. A palidrome is a word that is spelled the same forwards and backwards.
* 2. Write a method doubler(numbers), that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where every element of the original array is multiplied by 2.
* 3. Write a method fizz_buzz(max), that takes in a number max and returns an array containing all numbers greater than 0 and less than max that are divisible by either 4 or 6, but not both.
* 4. Write a method average_of_three(num1,num2,num3), that returns the average of three numbers entered.
* 5. Write a method goodbye(name), that takes in a string name and returns a string saying bye to that name.
